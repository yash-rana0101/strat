# Contributing to Strat

This is a **private, proprietary codebase**. Contributions are restricted to authorized internal developers and partners only. If you have been granted access, please read and follow these guidelines strictly to ensure code quality, performance, and security.

## 1. Codebase Architecture

Strat is structured as a monorepo containing multiple high-performance services written in Rust, Node.js, and TypeScript/Next.js:
* `/ingestion`: Ingests raw binary ticks from Zerodha Kite (Rust)
* `/alpha-terminal`: Aggregates ticks into tumbling 10m OHLC candles (Rust)
* `/agents`: Intelligence layer (Technical, Sentiment, Predictive, Quant-RAG agents)
* `/aggregator`: Decision fusion and strategy engine (Rust)
* `/auth`: Authentication microservice (Node.js/Express)
* `/frontend`: Tauri desktop shell and Next.js trading UI
* `/tools`: Simulation and load testing utilities

Before working on any service, read `AGENT_CONTEXT.md` for complete API interfaces, ports, and architectural constraints.

## 2. Development Workflow

### Step 1: Clone and Infrastructure
Ensure Docker is running and spin up the local infrastructure:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This starts QuestDB (TSDB), Redpanda (Kafka), PostgreSQL (Auth DB), and Redis.

### Step 2: Running in Test Mode
For local development without active Zerodha Kite credentials, run the project in test mode by setting the environment variable:
```bash
ALPHA_TEST_MODE=true
```
This forces the ingestion pipeline to use the `/tools/load_tester` mock data generator.

### Step 3: Run Order
To launch the full stack, open multiple terminal windows or runs:
1. Ingestion: `cargo run --bin ingestion`
2. OHLC Engine: `cargo run --bin alpha-terminal`
3. Agents (Predictive, Quant-RAG, Technical, Sentiment)
4. Decision Aggregator: `cargo run --bin aggregator`
5. Tauri/Frontend Desktop App: `cd frontend && npm run tauri dev`

## 3. Git Rules & Branching

* **Branch Naming:**
  * Features: `feature/your-feature-name`
  * Bug Fixes: `bugfix/issue-description`
  * Hot Fixes: `hotfix/critical-patch`
* **Pull Requests:** 
  * Target the `main` branch.
  * Every pull request must pass the automated test suites (Tauri tests, Cargo checks, Playwright E2E).
  * Requires a minimum of 1 code review approval.
* **Commit Messages:** Follow semantic commit messages:
  * `feat: add MacdHistogram calculation to consensus`
  * `fix: handle null values in Google News RSS scraper`
  * `perf: optimize chart updates by bypassing React state`

---

## 4. Code Quality & Standards

### Secrets and API Keys
> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER COMMIT plaintext API keys, passwords, or credentials.**
> All Zerodha Kite credentials and private credentials must be stored locally in the desktop client using the Tauri Stronghold Vault (uses Argon2id key derivation and AES-256 encryption). If any secret is accidentally committed to Git, notify the team instantly, invalidate the secret immediately, and rewrite git history to remove it.

### Rust Style
* Run `cargo fmt` before staging files to ensure styling compliance.
* Keep compiler warnings to zero. Use explicit types instead of broad castings where possible.
* Verify your math against `technical_indicators_analysis.md`.

### TypeScript / Next.js / CSS Style
* All UI layouts must adhere to `DESIGN.md` tokens. Never use arbitrary hex codes or random padding; rely on the HSL CSS custom properties.
* Render interactive components with smooth transitions using ease-out-expo easing: `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`.
* Support `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries globally.
* Keep numbers and monospace values in the UI wrapped with `font-mono` (JetBrains Mono).
* Chart updates **must bypass React reconciliation state** and be updated directly using Lightweight Charts API references to maintain sub-50ms latency.

## 5. Reporting Issues & Feedback

If you spot a bug or want to propose a new quantitative feature:
1. Create a detailed issue on our private GitHub repository.
2. Outline the steps to reproduce, actual vs expected behavior, and service logs.
3. If it is a security vulnerability, do NOT create a public issue. Follow the instructions in [SECURITY.md](file:///d:/projects/aitrader-landing/SECURITY.md) immediately.
